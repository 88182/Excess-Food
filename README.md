# Excess-Food
*OVERVIEW*
==========

TITLE: "Redistribution of consumable food by using Machine Learning."

ABSTRACT: This project presents a web application designed to bridge the gap between two critical entities:donors and individuals in need, including orphans and those requiring assistance. The application is divided into three primary segments: security and access control for donors, subscription options for supporters and event management for functions. Utilizing the Random
Forest algorithm in Machine Learning, the project assesses food quality and predicts spoilage,enhancing the efficiency of food donations. Donors and recipients are seamlessly connectedwithin a defined radius, with recipients responding through the application. A comprehensive database tracks historical contributions and sends reminders for future events. Feedbackmechanisms and ratings ensure a fulfilling experience for donors. This project fosters a senseof community and philanthropy, facilitating a positive impact on society.
